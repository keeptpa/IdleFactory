# Idle Factory
## What?
It's a web idle game(?) which's idea based on gregtech mod from minecraft and cookie clicker  
**It's still highly WIP.**
  
**A resource menu**

**A machine's interface**

##Roadmap  
✔ Basic system(Database, SingletonHolder, ModuleHolder...etc.)  
✔ Clicking Action   
✔ Item handling  
✔ Save n Load  
✔ Machines, and their interface sutff  
✔ Machine processing and Recipes  
✔ Item Tags System  
✔ Temperture based crafting machine and their burning chamber system.  
✔ Chat system. Tell your friend that he crafted a wrong machine.  
  
▶ Pipeline System(Logistic)  

## Why?
I wish I could play gregtech and cookie clicker while I'm busy,  
But it seems like no one had put something like automation factory on a website.  
So I did, it indeed difficult, to use blazor to make a game(?)  
I'm not sure how far I could go.
## It looks bad
Sorry, I'm not good at either programming and web design, but at least I would check these thing could work as intend.
