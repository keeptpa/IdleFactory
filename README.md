# Idle Factory
## What?
It's a web idle game(?) based on gregtech mod from minecraft and cookie clicker
## Why?
I wish I could play gregtech and cookie clicker while I'm busy,  
But it seems like no one had put something like automation factory on a website.  
So I did, it indeed difficult, to use blazor to make a game(?)  
I'm not sure how far I could go.
## It looks bad
Sorry, I'm not good at either programming and web design, but at least I would check these thing could work as intend.
